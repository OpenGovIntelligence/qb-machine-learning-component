# LOSD machine learning component

The Machine Learning Component enables the automatic extraction of numerous features from LOSD based on the needs of the users and the predictive scenario that is implemented. It also enables the performance of dimension reduction based on relevant algorithms such as Forward Subset, Backward Subset, and Lasso in a user friendly approach. The implementation of the Machine Learning Component is based on the JSON-QB API and R server.
